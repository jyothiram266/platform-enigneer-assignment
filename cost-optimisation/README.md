# Making Multi-Cloud Setups More Affordable

Let's face it - running systems across AWS and GCP isn't cheap. But we've got some practical ways to keep costs down while still getting the performance you need.

## Smarter Computing Costs

When it comes to the computing power that runs everything, there are several money-saving tricks:

For AWS:
- Use Spot Instances for your EKS worker nodes - they're up to 90% cheaper than regular instances
- For workloads you know will keep running, AWS Savings Plans or Reserved Instances make sense
- Let your system scale up or down automatically based on actual demand
- Try Graviton instances where possible - they can save about 40% compared to standard options

For GCP:
- Preemptible VMs can cut your GKE costs by around 80%
- If you're in it for the long haul, commit to Sustained Usage Discounts
- Make sure your system can automatically scale down when it's not busy
- Only pay for what you need with Custom Machine Types instead of over-provisioning

## Storage That Doesn't Break the Bank

Storage costs can sneak up on you if you're not careful:

For AWS:
- Let S3 Intelligent-Tiering automatically move rarely-accessed files to cheaper storage
- Set up lifecycle policies to move old logs and backups to Glacier for long-term storage
- Size your RDS instances appropriately, and consider Aurora Serverless for variable workloads
- Allow your storage to expand only when needed

For GCP:
- Use lifecycle policies to automatically move data to cheaper storage tiers when appropriate
- Let Cloud SQL adjust its resources based on actual usage
- Compress your data before storing it to use less space

## Cutting Network Costs

Moving data around can get expensive quickly:

For AWS:
- Use PrivateLink and VPC Endpoints to reduce data transfer fees
- Be strategic about NAT Gateway usage - consolidate where possible
- Compress data before sending it across the network

For GCP:
- Use Interconnect or VPN for hybrid setups instead of more expensive options
- Keep traffic inside your network with Internal Load Balancers when possible
- Use CDN and Cloud Armor to reduce the load on your servers

## Better Billing Practices

For both clouds:
- Set up alerts for unexpected spending increases
- Use the built-in cost monitoring tools to keep an eye on expenses
- Consolidate billing across accounts to qualify for volume discounts
- Consider open-source alternatives instead of paid services when they'll do the job

By putting these practices in place, you'll get the performance you need while keeping your cloud bills under control. It's about being smart with how you use these services, not just using less of them.
