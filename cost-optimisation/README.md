# Cloud Cost-Cutting Without the Headaches

Look, we've all been there. You open that monthly AWS or GCP bill and think, "How did we spend THAT much?!" Running stuff across multiple clouds is convenient but can drain your budget faster than free pizza disappears at an office lunch.

Here's how real teams are saving real money without sacrificing performance:

## Smart Ways to Cut Your Compute Costs

The servers that power everything are usually your biggest expense, but there are some clever tricks:

**In AWS-land:**
- Spot Instances can slash your EKS costs by up to 90% compared to regular instances. Yes, they might disappear occasionally, but with the right setup, your workloads can handle it.
- For those "always-on" workloads, Savings Plans and Reserved Instances are no-brainers. One team I worked with saved 42% just by committing to resources they knew they'd need anyway.
- Auto-scaling isn't just for handling traffic spikes—it's for your wallet too. Why pay for idle servers at 3 AM?
- Graviton instances (AWS's ARM-based option) can save you around 40%. One fintech startup switched and cut their compute bill almost in half.

**Over in GCP:**
- Preemptible VMs are like Spot Instances' cousin—up to 80% cheaper, with similar trade-offs.
- If you're not planning to switch clouds anytime soon, those Sustained Usage Discounts really add up over time.
- Make sure your Kubernetes clusters can scale down to zero when possible. Nothing's cheaper than a service that isn't running when nobody's using it.
- Custom Machine Types let you order exactly what you need instead of the pre-packaged sizes. It's like buying exactly 13 apples instead of being forced to buy a dozen or two dozen.

## Storage That Won't Empty Your Wallet

Storage costs are the sneaky ones—they just keep growing unless you're proactive:

**AWS storage hacks:**
- S3 Intelligent-Tiering is like having a robot butler move your rarely-used files to cheaper storage automatically. One media company saved 31% on storage without changing anything else.
- Those ancient logs and backups? Send them to Glacier and pay pennies instead of dollars.
- Right-sizing your RDS instances is like buying clothes that actually fit—more comfortable and less expensive. For variable workloads, Aurora Serverless can shrink when quiet.
- Storage that grows only when needed? Yes please. EBS auto-scaling prevents those midnight alerts about disks filling up.

**GCP storage moves:**
- Set up smart lifecycle policies that automatically shuffle aging data to Nearline and Coldline storage.
- Let Cloud SQL adjust itself based on what you're actually using, not what you think you might need someday.
- Compression before storage sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised how many teams skip this easy win. One e-commerce site compressed their logs and cut storage costs by 23%.

## Network Costs (Or: Data Doesn't Move for Free)

Moving bits between services can get surprisingly expensive:

**AWS networking tricks:**
- PrivateLink and VPC Endpoints are like secret tunnels that bypass expensive public data highways.
- NAT Gateways charge by the hour, so consolidate them when you can. One engineering team cut their bill by 17% just by reorganizing their NAT setup.
- Compress everything before it goes across the wire. Text-based data like logs and JSON can often shrink by 70-90%.

**GCP networking moves:**
- For hybrid setups, Interconnect or VPN connections beat paying for public data transfer.
- Internal Load Balancers keep traffic inside your network where it's cheaper (or free).
- CDN usage isn't just about speed—it's about cost. Let Cloud CDN handle those repeat requests instead of hitting your servers every time.

## Watching Your Bill Like a Hawk

For both clouds:
- Set up spending alerts that ping you BEFORE things get out of hand.
- The built-in monitoring tools aren't perfect, but they're free and catch the big stuff.
- Bundle accounts together for billing to unlock those volume discounts. One company saved 7% just by consolidating three separate accounts.
- Sometimes the best cloud service is no cloud service. That $300/month managed Kafka instance might be replaceable with a self-hosted open-source alternative.
