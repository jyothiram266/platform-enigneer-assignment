# Multi-Cloud Infrastructure CI/CD

This document describes the GitHub Actions workflow that handles continuous integration and deployment of infrastructure as code (IaC) across AWS and GCP environments.

## Workflow Overview

The workflow automates the deployment of infrastructure changes to both AWS and GCP clouds using Terraform. It includes linting, security scanning, and post-deployment health checks to ensure a reliable infrastructure deployment pipeline.

## Workflow Triggers

The workflow is triggered on:
- Push events to the `main` branch (deploys to production)
- Push events to the `stage` branch (deploys to staging)
- Only when changes are made to files within the `terraform/` directory

## Environment Variables

The workflow uses the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Value |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| `AWS_REGION` | AWS deployment region | us-east-1 |
| `GCP_PROJECT_ID` | GCP project identifier | Retrieved from repository secrets |
| `TF_VAR_environment` | Deployment environment | Determined based on branch (`main` â†’ prod, `stage` â†’ stage) |

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Lint and Security Checks

This job performs preparatory validation of the Terraform code:

- Checks Terraform formatting using `terraform fmt`
- Runs Checkov security scan to identify potential security issues
- Blocks further deployment if any checks fail

### 2. AWS Infrastructure Deployment

This job handles deployment to AWS and runs in parallel with GCP deployment:

- Configures AWS credentials from repository secrets
- Initializes Terraform
- Creates a deployment plan using environment-specific variables
- Applies the Terraform configuration to AWS
- Sends a notification to Slack if deployment fails

### 3. GCP Infrastructure Deployment

This job handles deployment to GCP and runs in parallel with AWS deployment:

- Authenticates with Google Cloud using service account credentials
- Initializes Terraform
- Creates a deployment plan using environment-specific variables 
- Applies the Terraform configuration to GCP
- Sends a notification to Slack if deployment fails

### 4. Post-Deployment Tests

After both cloud deployments complete successfully, this job:

- Performs health checks on the deployed AWS API endpoints
- Performs health checks on the deployed GCP API endpoints
- Sends a success notification to Slack if all tests pass

## Required Secrets

The following secrets must be configured in the GitHub repository:

| Secret Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | AWS IAM access key ID |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | AWS IAM secret access key |
| `GCP_PROJECT_ID` | Google Cloud project identifier |
| `GCP_CREDENTIALS` | Google Cloud service account JSON key |
| `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | Webhook URL for Slack notifications |

## Directory Structure

The workflow expects the following directory structure:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ terraform/           # Terraform configuration files
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ environments/        # Environment-specific configurations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ prod.tfvars      # Production Terraform variables
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ stage.tfvars     # Staging Terraform variables
â””â”€â”€ .github/
    â””â”€â”€ workflows/
        â””â”€â”€ multi-cloud-cicd.yml  # This workflow file
```

## Terraform Initialization

The workflow initializes Terraform directly without using backend configuration files:

```yaml
- name: Terraform Init
  run: terraform init
```

## Notifications

The workflow sends the following notifications to Slack:
- ðŸš¨ AWS Deployment Failed! Check the logs.
- ðŸš¨ GCP Deployment Failed! Check the logs.
- âœ… Multi-Cloud Deployment Successful!

## Success Criteria

A successful deployment must meet all the following criteria:
1. Pass all lint and security checks
2. Successfully apply Terraform configurations to both AWS and GCP
3. Pass all post-deployment health checks

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify that all required secrets are properly configured
3. Ensure the Terraform configuration is valid and formatted correctly
4. Verify that the environment variable files (*.tfvars) exist and are formatted correctly
