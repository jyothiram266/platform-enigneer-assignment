# Multi-Cloud Infrastructure Documentation

This repository implements a production-grade multi-cloud infrastructure across AWS and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Our infrastructure architecture prioritizes high availability, security, and scalability through strategic deployment of cloud-native services.

## Infrastructure Overview

Our AWS infrastructure centers around a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR block, featuring both public and private subnets across multiple availability zones. The network architecture implements NAT Gateways for secure outbound access from private resources while maintaining strict security boundaries. Within this network, we deploy an Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster running on t3.medium instances, configured for auto-scaling between 2-4 nodes to handle varying workloads efficiently. For data persistence, we utilize a multi-AZ PostgreSQL RDS deployment with KMS encryption and automated backup systems.

The GCP infrastructure mirrors this robust architecture with a 172.16.0.0/16 VPC implementation. Our Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster operates on n1-standard-2 machines with similar auto-scaling capabilities. The Cloud SQL instance provides PostgreSQL services with high availability configuration and private IP access, ensuring data security and consistent performance.

## Logging and Monitoring Strategy

Our logging architecture implements a comprehensive strategy across both cloud providers. In AWS, we utilize FluentBit DaemonSets within EKS to ship application logs to CloudWatch Logs, while infrastructure logs from VPC Flow Logs, EKS Control Plane, and RDS are automatically collected. CloudWatch provides centralized log analysis through Logs Insights, metrics monitoring, and customizable dashboards.

GCP's logging implementation leverages the Cloud Logging agent for application logs within GKE, automatically capturing and organizing logs by resource and severity. Infrastructure logging covers VPC flows, GKE control plane operations, and Cloud SQL activities. The Cloud Logging and Monitoring suite provides powerful analysis tools, including log-based metrics and error reporting capabilities.

## Security Implementation

Security is implemented through multiple layers across our infrastructure. Network security utilizes private subnets for sensitive resources, with carefully configured security groups and firewall rules controlling access. Data security implements encryption at rest through KMS in both clouds, along with TLS encryption for data in transit. Access control follows the principle of least privilege, using IAM roles and service accounts for precise permission management, while Kubernetes clusters implement RBAC and network policies for workload security.

## Deployment and Operations

Infrastructure deployment follows a streamlined workflow using Terraform. Prerequisites include properly configured AWS and GCP credentials, Terraform 1.0.0 or higher, and the respective cloud CLIs. Deployment proceeds through a standard Terraform workflow of initialization, planning, and application, followed by post-deployment tasks such as kubectl configuration and monitoring setup.

Operational maintenance encompasses regular resource utilization monitoring, security log reviews, and patch management. Our backup strategy includes daily RDS snapshots, Cloud SQL point-in-time recovery, Kubernetes state backups via Velero, and versioned state files in S3. Scaling is handled through auto-scaling configurations at both the infrastructure and application levels, with careful consideration given to resource optimization and cost management.

## Cost Management and Disaster Recovery

Cost optimization is achieved through right-sized instances, strategic use of auto-scaling, and implementation of reserved instances for predictable workloads. We maintain active monitoring of resource utilization and costs through budget alerts, usage thresholds, and regular cost analysis reviews.

Our disaster recovery strategy encompasses comprehensive backup procedures including database snapshots, configuration backups, and state file versioning. Recovery procedures are well-documented and regularly tested, covering database restoration, cluster rebuilding, and application redeployment processes.

## Future Development

Our infrastructure roadmap includes several key improvements focused on technical debt reduction and feature enhancement. Technical priorities include service mesh implementation, enhanced monitoring systems, and automated testing frameworks. Feature additions will focus on multi-region deployment capabilities, enhanced backup solutions, and advanced security implementations. We maintain a strong emphasis on infrastructure as code principles and continuous improvement of our cloud architecture.

## Support and Maintenance

The infrastructure includes robust monitoring checks covering service health, resource utilization, error rates, and latency metrics. Common operational challenges such as network connectivity issues, permission errors, and resource limits are well-documented with clear resolution procedures. Regular maintenance tasks ensure system reliability and security, while continuous monitoring enables proactive issue resolution and system optimization.
